Data Structures
===============
The purpose of this repo is to house exercises that I've done to get practice
with different data structures.


Main Idea Data Structures
-------------------------
In computer science, sets (of things in general) are dynamic: they can grow,
shrink, or otherwise change over time. We need different ways of representing
and manipulating sets on a computer, based on what we'd like to do with those
sets; in other words, the best way to implement a dynamic set depends on the
operations that must be supported. This is what data structures are (ways to
implement a dynamic set to support the operations which the application at hand
demands).
