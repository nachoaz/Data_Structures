Binary Trees
============

Description
-----------
A 'binary tree' is a rooted tree in which each node either doesn't have
children, or has at most 2 children. Of the nodes that do have children, each
has a 'left subtree' and a 'right subtree'. With the exception of the root node,
all nodes have a parent.
