TREES

Trees are a special case of Graphs. A free tree (or simply a 'tree') is an undirected, connected, acyclic graph. If an undirected graph is acyclic but disconnected, it's called  a 'forest', and the connected components of that forest are trees.

*******************************************
*   Some facts about trees (properties)   *
*******************************************
Note: any of these implies any of the others.
  (1) G is a free tree
  (2) Any two vertices in G are connected by a unique simple path.
  (3) G is connected, but if any edge is removed from G then the resulting graph is disconnected.
  (4) G is connected, and |E| = |V| - 1
  (5) G is acyclic, and |E| = |V| - 1
  (6) G is acyclic, but if any edge is added to G, then the resulting graph contains a cycle.

*   Rooted Trees and Ordered Trees   *
**************************************
A rooted tree is a tree in which one of the nodes r (the 'root') is distinguished from the others. We call any node y in the simple path from r to x an 'ancestor' of x. If y is an ancestor of x, then x is a 'descendant' of y. (Note that because of this definition, we have the silly implication that a node x is both an ancestor and a descendant of itself - this is why we have terms like 'proper ancestor' and 'proper descendant'.) A 'subtree rooted at x' is the tree induced by the descendants of x (this tree is rooted at x).

The last edge on the simple path from r to x connects the 'parent' of x to its 'child' (x). If two nodes have the same parent, they're said to be 'siblings'. A node with no children is a 'leaf' or 'external node'. A nonleaf node is an 'internal node'. In the context of a rooted tree, the degree of a node x is the number of children x has. (Note: in 'free' trees - and in undirected graphs in general - the degree of a node is simply the number of adjacent vertices or equivalently the number of edges incident on it. In a 'rooted' tree, however, the degree is the number of children - the parent of a node does not count toward its degree.)

The length of the simple path from r to x is the 'depth' of x, and the length of the simple path from r to the deepest leaf node is the 'height' of the tree. (This means the number of levels on a tree is equal to 1 + the height of the tree.)

An 'ordered tree' is a rooted tree in which the children of each node are ordered. That is, if a node has k children, then there's a first child, a second child, ..., and a kth child.

*   Binary Trees   *
********************
A 'binary tree' is a rooted tree in which each node either doesn't have children, or has at most 2 children. Of the nodes that do have children, each has a 'left subtree' and a 'right subtree'. With the exception of the root node, all nodes have a parent.

A 'complete k-ary tree' is a k-ary tree in which every level of the tree is fully filled, except for perhaps the last level. To the extent that the last level is filled, it is filled left to right.

A 'full k-ary tree' is a k-ary tree in which every node has either zero or two children. That is, no nodes have only one child.

A 'perfect k-ary tree' is a k-ary tree that is both full and complete. All leaf nodes will be at the same level, and this level has the maximum number of nodes. A perfect k-ary tree of n nodes has lg(n+1) levels (where lg(n+1) means logbase2 of (n + 1)).

***************************************************
*   Binary Search Trees: Big Idea and Variations  *
***************************************************
A 'Binary Search Tree' is a binary tree that adheres to the following principle (convention):
Let x be node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree of x, then y.key <= x.key If z is a node to the right subtree of x, then z.key >= x.key.

The big idea behind binary search trees is that they support the basic operations (search, insertion, deletion) and have a few added attractive features (they can give you the min and max of a set, and they can give you the predecessor and successor of any given element of the set), but - due to the potential imbalance in their structure - they carry out all of these operations in at worst O(n) time (and log(n) at best - actually, they carry out the operations in precisely O(h) - where h is the height - but because there's no guarantee that the bst is going to be balanced, the operations might take as long as O(n)), the generic BST is more of a springboard onto more specialized versions of bsts. One of these such specialized versions are Red-Black trees, which use a 'color' attribute on each node to guarantee (approximate) balance, which in turn guarantees 'good' (O(log(n))) performance on the basic operations.
